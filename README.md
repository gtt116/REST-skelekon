REST-skelekon
=============

A RESTfull API skelekon, like Openstack services


Intention
========

I want to show how openstack RESTFull app is created step by step, which from
version_1 to version_x. But actually openstack is not follow the processing.
That is just my option for easy understanding purpose. ^ ^
